March 11th 14:22pm - Watched videos on hand written Thompsons Construction and all the python tutorial videos previous 
to this date on Learnonline.

March 12th 11:13am - Watched videos up on Learnonline to view all areas of Thompsons Construction. 

March 16th 14:06pm- Began researching areas of how to start out project, also downloaded all necessary files to start project.

March 25th 17:13pm - Finished up on Thompsons Construction videos on Learnonline and began watching Shunting Yard on paper videos.

March 26th 00:32am - Drew diagram of NFA in project as reference.

March 27th 11:54am - Created the start state and the NFA by watching video on Learnonline.

March 28th 22:00pm - Created NFA using Thompsons Construction.

March 29th 18:37pm - Viewing Shunting Yard Algorithm coding video.

March 30th 19:05pm - Created the Shunting Yard Algorithm in seperate project, in process of merging both. Will update to git soon.

March 30th 23:33pm - Merged both algorithms together (Shunting/Thompsons) and watching the Regular Expression video on Learnonline.

March 31st 15:24pm - Fully watched Regular Expression video and have it coded. Will add to Git soon.

March 31st 15:38pm - All video code is now in project, currently researching the "+" operator and how to implement into Algorithm.

March 31st 17:57pm - Researched + operator, unsure how to fit into Algorithm for now. Also researched ? on the link in Regular
Expressions link area below.

March 31st 22:05pm - The README.txt was fully updated, explaining in detail how the program is run and what it does throughout to 
get the final result. The + operator was difficult to implement, and therefore is commented out/some code removed to show attempt.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Block 1 of Code:

Created the class state, creating our initial state and its position/where we start. 
edge1 and edge2 created to show where the state starts and where it moves to.
Class nfa created and shows our initial state and our accept state for the automaton.

Block 2 of Code: 

Created the constructor and also the for loop to deal with all of the extra characters/special characters.

Block 3 of Code:

For loop was edited. It now has ways of dealing with the stack. 
We have our ., | and * operators updated and can be dealt with.

Block 4 of Code: 

Shunting Yard Algorithm. This was implemented after Thompsons Construction was created and therefore 
block of code is inverted. When project is finished this will be fixed.
This algorithm is a stack based algorithm. It deals with operand/operator precedence in our NFA.

Block 5 of Code:

Matching Regular Expressions by combining Shunting/Thompsons Algorithms. We have created states to deal
with the E arrows/edges in the NFA, and have made next and current states to map out where we are in the
NFA diagram after an E arrow has executed.

Block 6 of Code: 

These are our expressions that we use to test the program. They will execute and will show as True or False 
through the "match" method.
