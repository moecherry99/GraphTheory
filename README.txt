Graph Theory Project - By Alex Cherry, G00347106.

Aim of this project : Creating a Non-Deterministic Finite Automaton (declared as NFA from now on) from a regular expression 
and using to check if the regular expression matches a given string of text.

---------------------------------------------------

Project run through project.py in folder in VS Code.

1. Go to file path and type in python project.py to run.

This project will take a regular expression from the Shunting Yard Algorithm and
then convert it into postfix notation. This essentially means moving the operands 
and the characters in their required order of precedence (such as BOMDAS). This 
program uses the *, . or | operators. A demo version of the Shunting Yard 
algorithms capabilities is shown at the start of the program to show you how it 
changes these given strings.


This will be developed as the project is created.
